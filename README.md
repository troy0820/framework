Hampton Roads PHP Framework
=============================
[Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/), [Symfony](http://symfony.com/), [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), and countless other web application frameworks are great contributions to the PHP community. The authors of those frameworks have a wealth of knowledge between them that is, in part, the by-product of their authorship.

While it may make sense to use battle-tested code for your production applications, you gain a formidable amount of experience working through the problems inherent in building your own framework.

This project is, at least for now, in existence so that developers have a place to work through complex problems -- request routing, input validation, translations, etc. -- with the guidance of other developers.
